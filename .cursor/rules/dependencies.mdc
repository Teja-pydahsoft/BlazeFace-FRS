# Dependencies and Environment

## Core Dependencies
From [requirements.txt](mdc:requirements.txt):
- `opencv-python>=4.8.0` - Computer vision and camera operations
- `numpy>=1.24.0` - Numerical operations and array handling
- `tensorflow>=2.13.0` - Machine learning and model inference
- `mediapipe>=0.10.5` - Face detection and landmark extraction
- `Pillow>=10.0.0` - Image processing and Tkinter integration

## Development Environment
- Python 3.8+ required
- Virtual environment recommended (see `venv/` directory)
- Windows development environment (PowerShell, batch files)

## Model Files
Required model files (should be in `models/` directory):
- `blazeface_640x640.tflite` - BlazeFace face detection model
- `facenet_keras.h5` - FaceNet embedding model
- `mobilenet_ssd.tflite` - Human detection model

## Configuration
- Update [app/config.json](mdc:app/config.json) for model paths and settings
- Adjust confidence thresholds based on testing results
- Configure camera settings for your hardware

## Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```
Or use [run.bat](mdc:run.bat) for Windows quick start.
